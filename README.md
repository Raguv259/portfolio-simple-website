# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It features a simple, clean design with two main pages: **Home** and **Contact**. The website is intended to introduce myself and provide an easy way for potential collaborators or employers to reach out.

### Pages:
- **Home Page**: An introduction to who I am, my skills, and my work. This page provides a snapshot of my background and showcases my passion for web development.
- **Contact Page**: A contact form where visitors can send me messages directly. This page provides easy access for anyone interested in getting in touch.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

### Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring it looks great on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Simple Navigation**: Easy-to-use navigation between the Home and Contact pages.

### How to View:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file (Home page) in your browser.
3. Navigate to the Contact page via the provided link.

### Future Enhancements:
- Implementing JavaScript for form validation and interactive elements.
- Adding more pages, such as a portfolio of projects or an "About Me" section.
- Styling improvements for a more modern look.

Feel free to explore and provide any feedback or suggestions!
